            <h1>Effects of Vitamin C Serum on Skin</h1><br />

            <p>
            <b>Brightens Skin Tone</b><br />
            Vitamin C helps fade dark spots, hyperpigmentation, and dullness, giving the skin a more radiant and even complexion.<br /><br />
        
            <b>Reduces Fine Lines and Wrinkles</b><br />
            As a powerful antioxidant, Vitamin C boosts collagen production, which helps maintain skin elasticity and reduces the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines.<br /><br />
        
            <b>Protects Against Sun Damage</b><br />
            Vitamin C neutralizes free radicals caused by UV exposure, reducing oxidative stress and preventing premature aging. However, it is not a replacement for sunscreen.<br /><br />
        
            <b>Hydrates and Plumps the Skin</b><br />
            Many Vitamin C serums are formulated with hyaluronic acid, which provides deep hydration, leaving the skin soft and plump.<br /><br />
        
            <b>Reduces Redness and Inflammation</b><br />
            Vitamin C has anti-inflammatory properties that help calm redness, irritation, and conditions like acne and rosacea.<br /><br />
        
            <b>Fades Acne Scars and Blemishes</b><br />
            Regular use of Vitamin C serum can help lighten post-acne marks and scars, promoting a clearer complexion over time.<br /><br />
        
            <b>Boosts Skin Healing</b><br />
            Vitamin C speeds up wound healing by encouraging tissue repair and reducing scarring.<br />
